The goal of the project is to provide farmers an online platform to sell their agriculture
products to the people who lives nearby. This project ‘Urban Agriculture Platform
for Smart Cities’ is designed to allow farmers to create an account to enter their list of
products for selling and caterers to create an account to enter their list of products
wanted. The app developed collects the product details from farmers and gives the
customers the list of products and farmers to purchase from it. The data is automatically
updated in the storage and profile of farmers and caterers are well managed. The
platform ensures real-time updates, so product availability and pricing remain accurate.
Payment and delivery are also made available for the customers. This helps in
improving the food security in each region by providing organic food products.
Additionally, the platform fosters community engagement by supporting small-scale
farmers, enhancing transparency in food sourcing, and encouraging eco-friendly
agricultural practices.
